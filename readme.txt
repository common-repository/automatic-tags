Automatically tag and categorize your posts.

== Description ==

Automatic Tags uses machine learning to automatically categorize and tag your posts.

Major features in Automatic Tags include:

* Suggests tags for your post within the editor, in 3 different ways.
 1. Existing tags mentioned in your post
 2. Keywords mentioned in your post
 3. Topics related to your post content
* Add all suggested tags with one click.
* Suggests a category for your post within the editor.

Note: To get suggestions, you'll need an API key from [wpautotag.com](https://wpautotag.com).
Keys are free and can be used on as many domains as you like.
While editing posts, this plugin will send basic information about your post to the wpautotag.com API. The following information about your post is sent: post content, title, categories, tags, domain name, and (optionally) counts of how many posts you've published in each category. You can decline to send category counts by turning on the "blank slate" option on the settings page.
Registering for an API key requires agreeing to the [privacy policy](https://wpautotag.com/privacy-policy/) and [terms of use](https://wpautotag.com/terms-of-use/) of wpautotag.com.

== Installation ==
